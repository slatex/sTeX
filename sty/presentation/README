presentation.sty: An Infrastructure for Presenting Semantic Macros

This package supplies an infrastructure that allows to specify the presentation of
semantic macros, including preference-based bracket elision. This allows to markup the
functional structure of mathematical formulae without having to lose high-quality
human-oriented presentation in {\LaTeX}. Moreover, the notation definitions can be used by
MKM systems for added-value services, either directly from the {\sTeX} sources, or after
translation.
