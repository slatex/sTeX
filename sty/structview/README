modules.sty: An Infrastructure for Semantic Macros and Module Scoping

The modules package supplies an infrastructure that allows mark up semantic macros 
and to reuse them efficiently in multiple environments.

This packge is a central part of the sTeX collection, a version of TeX/LaTeX that allows
to markup TeX/LaTeX documents semantically without leaving the document format,
essentially turning it into a document format for mathematical knowledge management
(MKM).

This package supplies a definition mechanism for semantic macros and a non-standard
scoping construct for them, which is oriented at the semantic depency relation rather
than the document structure. This structure can be used by MKM systems for
added-value services, either directly from the sTeX sources, or after translation.
